# Hi there, I'm Jorge Arteaga 👋

[Email](mailto:jorge.aranibar26@gmail.com) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/YOUR-LINKEDIN-USERNAME) I'm a Software Engineer and Co-founder based in Helsinki, Finland.

My passion is translating complex business concepts into highly functional, scalable, and user-centric web applications. I thrive on architecting end-to-end solutions and have a proven track record of leading products from the initial "what if" all the way to a successful market launch.

### 💡 My Engineering Philosophy

I believe shipping features is only half the job. True success comes from building systems that are performant, scalable, and maintainable.

* **Performance is a Feature:** I'm obsessed with optimization. In my recent roles, I've led migrations that resulted in a **40% improvement in page load times**, a **50% smaller CSS bundle**, and a **+20 point Lighthouse score increase**.

* **Scalability is in the Architecture:** I focus on modernizing API layers to handle growth and ensure data integrity. I've engineered solutions that **reduced unnecessary API calls by 60%** and led migrations from GraphQL to tRPC to achieve end-to-end type safety and **cut API response times by 150ms**.

* **From 0 to 1:** As a co-founder, I specialize in the entire product lifecycle. I can take a high-level business concept, architect the technical roadmap, and build the shippable, AI-powered MVP from the ground up.

### 🚀 Featured Work

Here are a few things I'm proud of. I recommend **pinning** these to your profile.

#### 1. cortosai.com & swagify.pro (AI SaaS Platforms)
As Co-founder & Lead Engineer, I led the end-to-end technical development of two AI-powered SaaS applications. I architected the full-stack infrastructure, designed scalable backend services for complex, asynchronous media processing, and integrated the AI models to bring these products from concept to launch.
* **Tech:** Next.js, Node.js, tRPC, Tailwind CSS, AWS, Firebase, AI Model APIs

#### 2. Enterprise CMS & API Optimization (Case Study)
Led a critical migration for a legacy CMS from React 16 to a modern Next.js 15 architecture. My solution for optimizing data workflows (serving clients like **Starbucks, KFC, and Pizza Hut**) **reduced redundant API calls by 60%**, saving significant infrastructure costs.
* **Key Outcomes:** 40% faster page loads, 60% fewer API calls.
